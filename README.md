# my-vim

This is the vim configuration that I use for basic development.


# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/robert-blankenship/my-vim/ ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
./setup.py
```

```
# Longer installation script, (install git)
which git || yum install -y git
git clone https://github.com/robert-blankenship/my-vim/ ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
./setup.py
```
